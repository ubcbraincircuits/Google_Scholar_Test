# Google Scholar Python Script

This is a script that can be used to get data on various researchers from Google Scholar via importing the names through a string array, and export it 
to a seperate .csv file. The script can output the researcher name, the quality of the search (whether an account by that name exists), affliation, h-index, h-index from the last 5 years, i-index, i-index from the last 5 years, number of citations ever and the three most recent publications listed on Google Scholar. 

This code has been updated to work with scholarly 1.2.0 (currently 1.2.2)
